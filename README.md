# Local-Vendor-app
```
The main idea is to have a platform where you can have access to inter-continental home-made dishes from different vendors.
Offering more visibilty for food vendors and convenient food search for customers.

The app serves as a market-place where vendors can create an account and post different type of food they make
 and customers can see a list of food created by different vendors before making a booking through their email
or redirect to other contact platform provided by the vendor.

The Project was with the MERN stack, HTML, CSS.
